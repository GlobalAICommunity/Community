2025: A Year That Changed Everything

2025 will be remembered as the year our community didn’t just grow — it came alive.

And the momentum was unmistakable. Our membership nearly doubled, growing from **89,000 to 178,000 members** — a powerful signal that people around the world are looking for a place to learn, share, and belong in the age of AI.

Our voice grew louder and clearer. We sent **52 weekly newsletters**, doubling our subscribers to **63,000** and delivering nearly **one million emails** into inboxes worldwide — week after week, keeping the community informed, inspired, and connected.

On YouTube, our story found a new visual dimension. With **80 long-form videos**, **76 shorts**, and **38 livestreams**, we welcomed **16,000 new subscribers**, reaching **25,000 in total**. Nearly **490,000 views** and **9,000 watch hours** showed that our content wasn’t just being watched — it was being valued.

Our website became a true global hub, attracting **250,000 unique visitors**, a staggering **360% increase** over last year. June emerged as our most popular month, with **India, the United States, and Germany** driving **50% of all traffic** — a clear reflection of our global reach.

On LinkedIn, our professional presence surged as well. Our followers tripled to **12,000**, amplifying our message across industries and regions.

Behind every metric were real people. We celebrated participation and learning by handing out **9,800 digital badges** to event attendees — tangible recognition of curiosity, effort, and growth.

The year kicked off with an unforgettable moment: the **Global AI Bootcamp**. Hosted in **161 locations worldwide**, it reached **230,000 people**, with **10,000 attending in person**. It set the tone for a year defined by scale, ambition, and community spirit.

Behind the scenes, we laid foundations for the future. We hired our **first Program Manager**, started a **Discord server**, and launched new content series like **Silicon Minds, Human Hearts**.
