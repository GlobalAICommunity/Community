# Organisation structure


## Global AI HQ
The board is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the Global AI Community, ensuring its financial stability, and overseeing its activities to ensure they align with the mission and goals of the organization. They may also play an active role in organizing events, securing sponsorships, forming partnerships, and promoting the organization's presence globally.

At present, the board comprises Sjoukje, Sammy, and Henk. This leadership team draws upon the counsel of regional directors to inform their decisions.


## Chapters
A chapter in the Global AI Community is a local branch that operates under the broader umbrella of the Global AI Community. It represents the interests and activities of the community in a specific geographical area, providing a local platform for members to meet, exchange ideas, collaborate, and organize events that resonate with the community's objectives. Chapters are instrumental in fostering a sense of belonging among local members, while also connecting them to the global network, resources, and opportunities that the parent community offers. They serve as the grassroots foundation of the community, enabling the mission and vision of the larger entity to be realized on a more personal and immediate level.

## Community Associate
An Associate Community is an independent group that partners with a larger organization to connect with a global network, share resources, and participate in international events, while maintaining its own identity and autonomy. This collaboration amplifies the group's reach and the opportunity to join global events.
