As community organizers, we pledge to intentionally foster diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging within every facet of our work. We commit ourselves to:  
   
1. **Respect and Value Diversity**: Recognize and honor the richness of diversity in race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion, socioeconomic status, ability, and lived experience.  
   
2. **Actively Seek Inclusion**: Ensure inclusive representation and participation at all levels, actively inviting underrepresented voices and providing equitable opportunities for engagement and leadership.  
   
3. **Cultivate a Welcoming Environment**: Create safe, accessible spaces that welcome diverse perspectives and experiences, and actively challenge discriminatory behaviors or attitudes.  
   
4. **Educate Ourselves and Others**: Continuously learn and reflect on systemic inequalities, biases, and privilege, and foster open dialogue to grow collectively.  
   
5. **Share Power and Leadership**: Commit to equitable distribution of decision-making power, resources, and opportunities, ensuring that leadership roles reflect the diversity of the communities we serve.  
   
6. **Hold Ourselves Accountable**: Regularly evaluate our progress toward diversity and inclusion goals, openly acknowledge shortcomings, and take corrective action.  
   
7. **Build Authentic Relationships**: Engage with diverse communities respectfully, thoughtfully, and authentically, ensuring trust, transparency, and mutual respect.  
   
8. **Advocate for Justice and Equity**: Actively identify, challenge, and dismantle systemic barriers to equity and inclusion within our community and beyond.  
   
By taking this pledge, we commit ourselves, individually and collectively, to building stronger, more equitable communities where everyone can thrive.
