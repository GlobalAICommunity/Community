# Start a Global AI Chapter

***You’ve decided to start your own Global AI chapter – YAY!***    
     
We’re excited to have people like you join our growing community and want to help you get your chapter launched as quickly and painlessly as possible. If our experience is any indication, your first major event will galvanize and inspire the AI community in your area and create momentum for subsequent events, so it’s crucial to start things off on the right foot!
To help you get started, we've put this guide together for starting your own Global AI chapter in your city. 
     
*The Global AI Community is your gateway into the global AI community!*

## Guidelines for Starting Your Chapter
When you start your own Global AI Chapter, you’ll be helping to build and grow a local AI community, through organizing events in your city.
A Global AI Chapter is not meant for a one-time event or workshop. There is an expectation for ongoing community activities through your chapter, at least once every three months. Some of our groups hold events on a monthly cadence.    
We require at least two organizers in your group to help share the workload and prevent burnout from any single organizer.
When requesting a chapter, we ask that it be local and city-based. If an existing chapter already exists in your city, a second one may be allowed depending on circumstances.

## Role and Responsibilities of the Chapter lead

You will help organize or support co-organization of at least one meetup per three months.

**Work together**   
We require at least two organizers in your group to help share the workload and prevent burnout from any single organizer.
You will be responsible for notifying Global AI Community leadership of changes in your organizing team. For example, if you have new organizers, or if an organizer stepped down.
   
**Be part of the Global Community**

**Be inclusive to everyone**    
Have an open registration for events and free entrance.
   
**Create a safe place**    
All Global AI events (Meetups, conference lunches, etc), online spaces (IRC, Facebook, etc) are beholden to the Global AI Community Code of Conduct. Every chapter is required to make the code of conduct public in some way. 
   
**Be the brand**    
Only use your @globalai.community email to communicate with your members.
Once your chapter has been approved, you and your group agree to use your chapters @globalai.community email address to conduct your business. For example, for any email communications with your members, and for creating meetup and social media accounts.
