If our experience is any indication, your first major event will galvanize and inspire the AI community in your area and create momentum for subsequent events, so it’s crucial to start things off on the right foot!

*The Global AI Community is your gateway into the global AI community!*

## Guidelines for Starting Your Chapter
When you start your own Global AI Chapter, you’ll be helping to build and grow a local AI community, through organizing events in your city.
A Global AI Chapter is not meant for a one-time event or workshop. There is an expectation for ongoing community activities through your chapter, at least once every three months. Some of our groups hold events on a monthly cadence.
We require at least two organizers in your group to help share the workload and prevent burnout from any single organizer.
When requesting a chapter, we ask that it be local and city-based. If an existing chapter already exists in your city, a second one may be allowed depending on circumstances.
