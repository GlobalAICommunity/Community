# About the Global AI Community

We are an international not for profit organisation with a focus on helping people learn about AI by connecting local communities around the world. 
Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse AI community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

## Our mission & vision
Our mission is to connect AI communities across the world to share ideas and content with each other. We want to enable AI enthusiasts and professionals to join local user groups, connect with like-minded peers, or start their own chapters.

## What we do?
The Global AI Community empowers developers who are passionate about AI to share knowledge through events and meetups. We host 3 global AI events across 100 locations that span every corner of the globe. We also provide a variety of resources to members of the community, including a spnosred Meetup Pro account for user groups, event-in-a-box content, Azure passes, and support for booking Microsoft venues. We work closely with product teams at Microsoft to share workshop content about the newest Azure AI products.
