# Code of Conduct

## Summary

The Global AI Community Code of Conduct provides a clear set of guidelines designed to foster a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for all participants—whether attending online or in-person events. Drawing on best practices from established models like the Contributor Covenant, it articulates expected behaviors, enumerates unacceptable actions, and explains reporting and enforcement procedures to maintain community standards  ([Contributor Covenant: A Code of Conduct for Open Source and ...](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([Best practices guide for a Code of Conduct for events](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/Best-Practices/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
